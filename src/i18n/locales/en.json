    "philosophy_title": "Our Philosophy",
    "philosophy": "Opus was created out of many years of experience in foreign language education and a commitment to international standards. While measurable results matter to us, our core belief is that truly effective learning happens when students also enjoy the process of learning itself.\n\nOur teachers are all trained linguists with strong academic backgrounds. Their research and professional interests focus on different aspects of foreign language learning, and alongside their teaching, they continuously study new languages themselves. By remaining learners in their own right, they stay closely connected to the challenges students face and are able to make the learning experience clearer, more supportive, and more approachable.\n\nThe name and philosophy of Opus are inspired by Aristotle. In his writings, he emphasizes that philosophy and great achievements grow out of leisure and free time - moments free from pressure, where thinking and creativity can unfold. The Latin word opus means both a work and an achievement, something in progress as well as something completed. In this spirit, each course at Opus is seen as its own \"opus\" - whether it is English or Georgian - a meaningful undertaking that, through curiosity and enjoyment, becomes a shared achievement. At Opus, learning is not treated as a struggle or a race to the top. The process itself is valued as a time of exploration and enjoyment, and its results emerge naturally through consistent, thoughtful work.",

These up-to-date materials also support learning the language in a modern and relevant way.\n\nFor adult learners, levels A1, A2, and A2+ are taught exclusively by a Georgian teacher to ensure that the foundational structure of the language is developed in a clear and comfortable way. At levels B1, B1+, B2, and C1, Georgian and foreign teachers work together: the Georgian teacher supports students with grammar, reading comprehension, writing skills, and vocabulary development, while the foreign teacher focuses on speaking in English and listening comprehension.\n\nFor children and teenagers, Georgian and foreign teachers teach together at all levels.",

    "what_is_cefr_content": "When searching for a suitable educational centre, you will often come across the rather vague phrase \"modern teaching methods.\" In most cases, this refers to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).\n\nCEFR was developed and published by the Council of Europe in 2001 to replace the many inconsistent and often unclear language teaching systems that existed before. It provides a single, internationally recognized standard for describing language proficiency across all languages - from beginner level (A1) to full proficiency (C2). Within this framework, each level clearly defines what a learner should be able to do in a foreign language upon completion.",
    "how_does_cefr_work": "How Does CEFR Work?",
    "how_does_cefr_work_content": "CEFR is based on descriptive indicators (descriptors) that show what a learner should be able to do in a foreign language at the completion of each level. These descriptors cover all core language skills - listening, speaking, reading, and writing - as well as more recent areas such as mediation (helping others understand texts or ideas) and plurilingual competence (using different languages together).\n\nRather than focusing on memorizing grammar rules or copying words from dictionaries, CEFR emphasizes practical ability - how effectively a learner can use the language in real, everyday situations. By clearly separating proficiency levels, CEFR also helps move away from the outdated idea that a language is something you either \"know\" or \"don't know.\"",

            "a": "Opus was created by linguists and educators, not sales managers. Our courses are academically grounded, thoughtfully paced, and designed by teachers who actively research and reflect on how languages are learned. We focus not only on what students learn, but how they experience learning."
          },
          {
            "q": "What is Opus's teaching philosophy?",
            "a": "We believe that effective learning happens when students understand why language works the way it does. Our approach combines clear structure, communicative practice, and linguistic awareness, while maintaining a supportive and motivating classroom environment. Learning should feel challenging, engaging, and achievable - not stressful or mechanical."
          },
          {
            "q": "Do your teachers have academic qualifications?",
            "a": "Yes. All Opus teachers hold academic degrees in linguistics, philology, or related fields. Many are also involved in academic research or university teaching. This ensures that our courses are not only practical, but also scientifically informed and pedagogically sound."

            "a": "Currently, Opus offers English and Georgian as a second language. Our English courses focus on communicative competence and global skills, while Georgian courses are designed specifically for non-native speakers and follow a structured linguistic approach. We plan to introduce additional languages and courses in the future as Opus continues to grow."

          {
            "q": "Do you offer conversational / speaking-focused classes?",
            "a": "From B1 level and above, General English courses are taught in collaboration with a native-speaker teacher, who focuses primarily on speaking and listening skills. This approach allows students to develop natural fluency, pronunciation, and real-life communication.\n\nThe collaboration between Georgian and native-speaker teachers ensures that all language skills - speaking, listening, reading, and writing - are developed in a balanced and academically sound way, with careful attention to accuracy, clarity, and practical use.\n\nGeorgian classes are designed to help foreigners living in Georgia integrate more easily into the local community. Alongside a strong focus on speaking and everyday communication, students also learn the basics of Georgian grammar, ensuring a comprehensive and well-structured learning experience."

          {
            "q": "How do I know which level is right for me? Do you offer placement tests?",

We also remain flexible - if the assigned level later turns out to be too easy or too challenging, we can adjust the placement to ensure the best possible learning experience."
